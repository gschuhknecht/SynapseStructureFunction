Code for analysis of EPSP recordings and SMAQ quantal analysis, includes:
- selecting stable epochs of EPSP recordings
- plotting histograms of stable EPSP recordings
- computing the statistics of the stable EPSP recordings
- running SMAQ quantal analysis
- computing the reliability of SMAQ quantal analysis by constructing Bayesian-inspired confidence intervals around SMAQ solutions.

Instructions:
- run analyses from 'Analysis_main_file.m' in folder 'Code'
- example data are provided in the folder 'Raw Data'
